/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window/Global Object Binding
    In the global scope, 'this' is the global object.

* 2. Implicit Binding
    Implicit binding is when 'this' refers to the object preceding the .function().

* 3. New Binding
    When a constructor function is used, that is, when a new object is created using a function, 'this' refers to the created object.

* 4. Explicit Binding
    When using the .call or .apply function, 'this' is the called object.
    .call and .apply overide the implicit binding.

*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
